Twitter sentiment analysis with multiclass logistic regression

Sentiment Analysis is a branch of NLP that allows us to determine algorithmically where a statement or document is "positive" or "negative"
This is a guide for sentiment analsysis and how to use build and test your model.

In this twitter sentiment analsysis, there are 5 different sections: 

1.Cleaning data
Remove html tags, attributes, URLS, stopwords.
Html characters replaced with an ASCII equivalent

2.Exploratory analysis
What can data tell you?

3.Model preparation and implementation
The idea of this step was to train a model using "A" data set and use it on "B" data set and check with results that given from "B"
Also train a multiple class logistic regression model and check its accuracy

A logistic regression was used to train data from generic tweets(Trainning 70% data and testing 30% data) 
TF-IDF methods was used and explained in the notebook

4.Discussion 
My thoughs from step 1 - step 4.

5.Bonus section
Compared model performance between:
LinearSVC, Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB and Random Forest Classifier.

This code can be used on any NLP analysis. 
Hope you enjoy!
